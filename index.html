      <p class="text-muted"> The Great Hall in the Hogwarts Castle was the main gathering area in the school, which
         was located off the Entrance Hall. It was a large hall where students and teachers dined and congregated.
         Three meals a day were hosted in this hall.The Great Hall was the main place where students received
          their meals and daily owl post. They also held certain special events, such as the Sorting ceremony,
           and the Hallowe'en Feast. The large hall had enough space to hold every student, as well as the main
           staff and guests. The Hall had tall walls that reached up to the ceiling, which was covered with floating
            candles and enchanted to look like the sky above. At the front of the hall was the staff table, also
             known as the High Table, which was designed to house the entire Hogwarts staff. In the centre of the 
             table was a throne chair where the present Headteacher sat. At the left of the table was a door
              which led to a chamber with portraits.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">There was a door on the right side of the Entrance Hall (if coming down the Marble 
          Staircase facing the front doors of the castle) that was most frequently used by Slytherin students to 
          get to their common room. Behind the door was a set of stone steps which descended deep into the dungeons.
          Note that this door was different from the entrance to the narrow staircase that led down to Snape's
           office.The entrance to the common room was located behind a bare stretch of stone wall in the dungeons 
           of Hogwarts Castle. A password was required to enter it; whereupon a passage was revealed leading to the
            common room.The common room was a dungeon-like room with greenish lamps and chairs. This dungeon
             extended partway under the lake, giving the light in the room a green tinge. The common room had lots 
             of low backed black and dark green button-tufted, leather sofas; skulls; and dark wood cupboards.
              One of the wooden tables had a Wizard's Chess set on it. It was decorated with tapestries featuring 
              the adventures of famous Medieval Slytherins. It has quite a grand atmosphere, but also quite a 
              cold one.

      </h5>
      
      <p class="text-muted">The Ravenclaw Common Room was one of the airiest rooms at Hogwarts. It was a wide,
         circular room with graceful arched windows that punctuated the walls which were hung with blue and bronze
          silks and a midnight blue carpet covered in stars, which was reflected onto the domed ceiling. The room
           was furnished with blue tables, chairs, and a divan. Next to the door leading up to the dormitories
            stood a tall statue of Rowena Ravenclaw made of white marble. According to Prefect Robert Hilliard,
             the sound of wind whistling around the windows of the tower was relaxing while going to sleep. 
             Portraits of famous Ravenclaws hung on the walls.The Ravenclaws also had their own library within
              the common room, which was nowhere as big as the main library, but had almost as many books. 
              The personal library was located in a niche.During the day, Ravenclaw students had a spectacular 
              view of the school grounds, including the Great Lake, Forbidden Forest, Quidditch pitch, Herbology 
              greenhouses and the surrounding mountains. </p>

      <p class="text-muted">
        The Hufflepuff common room is entered from the same corridor as the Hogwarts kitchens. Proceeding past the
         large still life that forms the entrance to the latter, a pile of large barrels is to be found stacked in 
         a shadowy stone recess on the right-hand side of the corridor. The barrel two from the bottom, middle of 
         the second row, will open if tapped in the rhythm of 'Helga Hufflepuff'. As a security device to repel 
         non-Hufflepuffs, tapping on the wrong barrel, or tapping the incorrect number of times, results in one of 
         the other lids bursting off and drenching the interloper in vinegar.A sloping, earthy passage inside the 
         barrel travels upwards a little way until a cosy, round, low-ceilinged room is revealed, reminiscent of a 
         badger's sett. The room is decorated in the cheerful, bee-like colours of yellow and black, emphasised by
          the use of highly polished, honey-coloured wood for the tables and the round doors which lead to the boys'
           and girls' dormitories (furnished with comfortable wooden bedsteads, all covered in patchwork quilts).A 
           colourful profusion of plants and flowers seem to relish the atmosphere of the Hufflepuff common room.</p>

         day of studying. It was full of squashy armchairs, tables, and a bulletin board where school notices, ads,
          lost posters, etc. could be posted. The common room was decorated in several shades of red, which was 
          associated with the house. The common room was comfortable, but not more comfortable than the Hufflepuff 
          Basement.There were many windows that looked out onto the grounds of the school, and a large fireplace 
          dominated one wall. The mantle of the fireplace was adorned with a portrait of a lion. The fireplace was
           also connected to the Floo Network, but as it was extremely public except in the dead of night. 
           The walls were decorated with scarlet tapestries that depicted witches and wizards, but also various 
           animals. There were also bookcases located in the room, filled with various novels</p>

  Professor Remus John Lupin also known as Moony is a half-blood wizard He was attacked by werewolf Fenrir
   Greyback when he was a child, leaving Remus afflicted with Lycanthropy for life. He attended Hogwarts School
   of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1971-1978 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. During his school years he was
    one of the Marauders, best friends with Sirius Black, James Potter, and Peter Pettigrew. Together, they created
     the Marauder's Map.After Hogwarts, Remus and his friends joined the original Order of the Phoenix and fought
      in the First Wizarding War. However, Pettigrew betrayed James and Lily Potter to Lord Voldemort a week after 
      he was made the couples' Secret Keeper. Thus Remus had lost all of his closest friends in various ways by the
       end of the First Wizarding War. The loss of his friends devastated him, though he and Sirius Black later 
       rekindled their friendship.

    At its first appearance, a Dementor is described as a "cloaked figure". "Its face was completely hidden beneath.
    Dementors are dark creatures that consume human happiness, creating an ambiance of coldness, darkness, misery 
    and despair. Because of their power to drain happiness and hope from humans, they have been set the duty of 
    being guards at Azkaban, where they prevent the prisoners from having the will or ability to escape.
    This creature has the property that only wizards can see it. Muggles can still feel them, though. Its only 
    known ability, besides the happiness drain, is the ability to perform the "Dementor's Kiss", which is the act 
    of extracting the human soul through the mouth, leaving nothing more than a living body. This process is irreversible.
    They "are among the foulest creature that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in
    decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their 
    presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will 
    sucked out of you.If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself 
    soulless and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life."The reason is because a 
    crimnal has escaped from Azcabzn and is very dangerous and is known by the name Serius Black.
